## Local App Configuration

The application is configured for:

- Production local URL: `http://<IP-LAN>
- Laravel environment: `production`
- Debug mode: off
- PostgreSQL database: `kusumavision_nms`
- Redis cache/session/queue
- Encrypted Redis-backed sessions
- Reverb broadcasting
- Indonesian locale
- Config/events/routes/views cache enabled

Sensitive values are stored in `.env`; `.env.example` only contains placeholders.
The `.env` file is ignored by Git and permissioned as `640 root:www-data`.

## Network & Host Hardening

- Nginx serves only `/var/www/KusumaVisionNMS/public`.
- Nginx denies dotfiles and common sensitive file extensions.
- Nginx security headers enabled: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy`.
- Nginx HTTP allow-list includes private LAN ranges plus `<subnet-admin>`.
- UFW is active with default incoming deny and outgoing allow.
- UFW allows SSH `22/tcp` and HTTP `80/tcp` from private LAN ranges plus `<subnet-admin>`.
- SSH is key-only: `PasswordAuthentication no`.
- Root SSH login is restricted to key authentication: `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`.
- X11 forwarding is disabled.
- PHP-FPM production override disables PHP exposure and browser error display.

## Background Processes

- `kusumavision-worker` runs `php artisan queue:work redis --tries=1` via Supervisor as `www-data`.
- `kusumavision-scheduler` runs `php artisan schedule:work` via Supervisor as `www-data`.
- Scheduler dispatches `php artisan olts:poll` every minute; each OLT is polled only when its configured interval is due.
